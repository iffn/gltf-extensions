# OMI_vehicle mappings

This document describes how the OMI_vehicle extensions map to different games, game engines, and platforms.

The term "import" refers to bringing the OMI_vehicle extension data into a game or game engine. The term "export" refers to taking objects from a game or game engine and converting them into OMI_vehicle extension data.

In general, every property in the OMI_vehicle extensions is listed in the tables below, except that the "current" properties are omitted in most cases, because these are usually determined at runtime and do not have any special notes for import/export.

## Empyrion Galactic Survival

Empyrion Galactic Survival has space vessels and hover vessels, and no wheeled vehicles except for the motorbike.

| OMI_vehicle_body     | Empyrion      | Additional Notes                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **gyroTorque**       | RCS block     | Comes in various sizes from 50 kNm to 150 MNm. On export, sum the torque of all RCS blocks.  |
| **maxSpeed**         | 60 to 130 m/s | Depends on type of vessel and the environment (space/atmosphere).                            |
| **pilotSeat**        | Cockpit block | The cockpit block is the pilot seat.                                                         |
| **angularDampeners** | Pilot Mode    | Enabling Pilot Mode will hold a specific rotational speed. This is the inverse of dampeners. |
| **linearDampeners**  | Auto Brake    | Hover engines always have dampeners, Auto Brake only controls non-hover thrusters.           |
| **useThrottle**      | Not available | Empyrion does not have throttle controls.                                                    |

Empyrion also has "Auto Rotate", which is a button that can be held to automatically rotate the vessel to be upright. Neither this nor Pilot Mode are perfect matches for the OMI_vehicle_body `"angularDampeners"` property. However, note that the vehicle can also be powered off to disable all dampeners.

| OMI_vehicle_thruster | Empyrion                 | Additional Notes                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **maxForce**         | Depends on thruster type | Comes in various sizes from 55 kN to 920 MN. |
| **maxGimbal**        | Not available            | Empyrion thrusters do not gimbal.            |

Empyrion allows toggling thrusters on and off

For hover thrusters, Empyrion's hover engines have a force measured in kN, the same as non-hover thrusters, but are handicapped so that they stop working beyond a certain height above the ground. For OMI_vehicle_hover_thruster, there is no artificial height limit, instead they operate with a force that is proportional to the distance from the ground - the closer to the ground, the more force they provide. The OMI_vehicle_hover_thruster `maxHoverEnergy` property is measured in Newton-meters (N⋅m or kg⋅m²/s²), so dividing this number by the amount of meters above the ground will give the force in Newtons (N).

## Godot Engine

Godot Engine's built-in vehicles are designed to be cars, but its feature set is extended by the Godot implementation of the OMI_vehicle extensions.

| OMI_vehicle_body     | Godot Engine      | Additional Notes                                                                         |

| **useThrottle**      | Use Throttle      | Part of PilotedVehicleBody3D, provided by the OMI_vehicle_body extension implementation. |

Note: Godot's built-in VehicleBody3D system is designed for body-wide motion parameters, but OMI specifies all motion as per-part. As a result, there is not a lot of overlap between VehicleBody3D's built-in parameters and what is actually used by the OMI_vehicle_body extension implementation in Godot. The OMI_vehicle extensions were designed to be very general-purpose for all kinds of vehicles, not just cars.

| **suspensionStiffness**          | Suspension Stiffness | Vanilla Godot VehicleWheel3D. Godot is Mg/s² (N/mm), while OMI_vehicle_wheel us kg/s² (N/m) |
| **suspensionTravel**             | Suspension Travel    | Vanilla Godot VehicleWheel3D.                                                               |

Additionally, the OMI_vehicle_thruster extension has a 1:1 mapping with the VehicleThruster3D node provided by the OMI_vehicle_thruster extension implementation in Godot. Since it is identical, a table is not provided for it.

## Jolt Physics

Jolt is a physics engine which has a built-in vehicle system, designed for cars and other wheeled vehicles. Jolt's vehicle controller is very low-level and does not map to the OMI_vehicle_body properties, so another system would need to be built on top to support OMI_vehicle_body's input and handling properties.
